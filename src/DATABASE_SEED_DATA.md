## Usage Instructions

### For Database Import

1. **Parse JSON**: Each learning path object can be directly imported into your database
2. **Generate IDs**: Replace numeric IDs with UUIDs if using Supabase/PostgreSQL
3. **Timestamps**: Convert `createdAt` to your database's timestamp format
4. **Relations**: Set up foreign keys between `paths → chapters → questions`

### Field Mapping

```javascript
// Supabase table: learning_paths
{
  id: uuid,
  title: text,
  description: text,
  difficulty: enum('Foundation', 'Intermediate', 'Expert'),
  estimated_time: text,
  categories: text[], // Array of strings
  thumbnail_url: text,
  xp_reward: integer,
  status: enum('draft', 'published'),
  target_roles: text[],
  target_goals: text[],
  created_at: timestamp
}

// Supabase table: chapters
{
  id: uuid,
  path_id: uuid (foreign key),
  title: text,
  description: text,
  order: integer
}

// Supabase table: questions
{
  id: uuid,
  chapter_id: uuid (foreign key),
  type: enum('content', 'multiple-choice', 'true-false', 'multiple-answer', 'matching', 'fill-blank'),
  question: text,
  hint: text (nullable),
  points: integer,
  image_url: text (nullable),
  video_url: text (nullable),
  options: jsonb (for MC/MA questions),
  correct_answer: boolean (for T/F),
  blanks: jsonb (for fill-blank),
  left_items: text[] (for matching),
  right_items: text[] (for matching),
  correct_matches: jsonb (for matching),
  feedback: text,
  order: integer
}
```

### Quick Start SQL (PostgreSQL/Supabase)

```sql
-- Create learning paths table
CREATE TABLE learning_paths (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  difficulty TEXT CHECK (difficulty IN ('Foundation', 'Intermediate', 'Expert')),
  estimated_time TEXT,
  categories TEXT[],
  thumbnail_url TEXT,
  xp_reward INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'published')) DEFAULT 'draft',
  target_roles TEXT[],
  target_goals TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create chapters table
CREATE TABLE chapters (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  path_id UUID REFERENCES learning_paths(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  order_index INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create questions table
CREATE TABLE questions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  chapter_id UUID REFERENCES chapters(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('content', 'multiple-choice', 'true-false', 'multiple-answer', 'matching', 'fill-blank')),
  title TEXT,
  question TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  hint TEXT,
  points INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  image_url TEXT,
  video_url TEXT,
  options JSONB,
  correct_answer BOOLEAN,
  feedback_correct TEXT,
  feedback_incorrect TEXT,
  feedback TEXT,
  blanks JSONB,
  left_items TEXT[],
  right_items TEXT[],
  correct_matches JSONB,
  sentence TEXT,
  order_index INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_chapters_path ON chapters(path_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_chapter ON questions(chapter_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_paths_status ON learning_paths(status);
```

## Data Quality Notes

- **All fields populated**: Every path includes all new PathEditorFull fields
- **Realistic content**: Church ministry-focused scenarios and questions
- **Varied question types**: Each path uses all 6 question types multiple times
- **Difficulty progression**: Foundation paths are simpler; Intermediate have more complexity
- **Image URLs**: Unsplash URLs provided (replace with actual hosted images)
- **Video placeholders**: Replace `example-vision` etc. with real YouTube IDs

---

## Extending the Seed Data

To add more paths:

1. Follow the same JSON structure
2. Ensure unique IDs across all objects
3. Include all required fields
4. Use varied question types
5. Match categories to the 12 available options
6. Align difficulty with content complexity
