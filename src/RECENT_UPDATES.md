## 🎯 2. Onboarding - Simplified Path Selection

### What Changed
Step 6 of onboarding now allows **selecting only ONE path** instead of multiple paths.

### Changes Made

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Your Personalized Paths" | "Your Recommended Path" |
| Select 1-3 paths | Choose one path |
| Multi-select (array) | Single select (single value) |
| "Personalized" (US/UK confusion) | "Recommended" (universal) |

### Technical Changes
- **State**: `selectedPaths` (array) → `selectedPath` (single value)
- **Handler**: `handlePathToggle()` → `handlePathSelect()`
- **Validation**: `selectedPaths.length === 0` → `!selectedPath`

### User Experience
- ✅ Clearer decision making
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load
- ✅ Better first-time experience
- ✅ Users can explore more paths from dashboard later

### Updated Helper Text
> 💡 Choose the path that interests you most. You can explore other paths anytime from your dashboard!

### Username Field Added
- ✅ New username field in Step 4 (Account Creation)
- ✅ Positioned above email address
- ✅ Required field with validation
- ✅ Placeholder: "Choose a unique username"
- ✅ Added to user data structure

### Login Page Simplified
- ✅ Removed password strength indicator from Login.tsx
- ✅ Password strength kept in Onboarding.tsx only
- ✅ Cleaner login experience for returning users
- ✅ No visual feedback during password entry
- ✅ Validation only happens on form submit

---

## 📁 3. File Structure Fixes

### Issue
System files (`LICENSE`, `public/_redirects`) keep becoming directories with React components inside them.

### Fixed Files
- `/LICENSE` - Restored as MIT License text file
- `/public/_redirects` - Restored as Netlify redirect config

### Prevention
These should remain simple text files and not be converted to directories.

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Existing Path Data
If you have existing paths, they may not have these new fields:
- **difficulty**: Will default to empty (needs manual entry)
- **estimatedTime**: Will default to empty
- **categories**: Will default to empty array `[]`
- **xpReward**: Will default to `300`
- **thumbnailUrl**: Will default to empty

### Backwards Compatibility
- ✅ Old data structure still works
- ✅ Missing fields display as empty/default
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

---

## 💡 Next Steps Recommendations

### For Admins
1. Update existing paths with new metadata
2. Add categories to all published paths
3. Set difficulty levels appropriately
4. Upload/add thumbnail images for better UX

### For Development
1. Consider adding category filter to Browse page
2. Maybe add difficulty badges to course cards
3. Could display estimated time more prominently
4. Consider auto-calculating XP based on questions
