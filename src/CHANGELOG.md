### ðŸŽ¯ Onboarding Path Selection Improvements
**Date**: Current Session

#### Single Path Selection (Simplified UX)

Changed the onboarding path recommendation step from multi-select to single-select for better focus:

**Changes Made:**
1. **State Management:**
   - Changed from `selectedPaths` (array) â†’ `selectedPath` (single value)
   - Updated `handlePathToggle()` â†’ `handlePathSelect()`
   - Button validation: checks for single selection instead of array length

2. **UI/UX Updates:**
   - Heading: "Your Personalized Paths" â†’ "Your Recommended Path"
   - Description: "we've curated these" â†’ "we recommend starting with one of these"
   - Helper text: "Select 1-3 paths" â†’ "Choose the path that interests you most"
   - Clearer single-selection UX with green highlight on selected card

3. **Terminology Change:**
   - Removed "Personalized" to avoid US/UK spelling confusion
   - Now uses "Recommended" throughout
   - More accurate - paths are recommended based on role/goals

**Benefits:**
- Simpler decision making for new users
- Clearer onboarding flow
- Reduced cognitive load
- Users can explore more paths after onboarding
